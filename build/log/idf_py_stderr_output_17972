CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/SOP/VISIO_arrow_detection/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/saket/devlopment/visio_user_study/esp-tflite-micro/examples/person_detection/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "C:/SOP/VISIO_arrow_detection/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/Users/saket/devlopment/visio_user_study/esp-tflite-micro/examples/person_detection/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
